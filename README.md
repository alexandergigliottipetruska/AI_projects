# My Deep Learning Journey
In order to document and track my progression through studying Deep Learning, I've created this github repository as a track and review all of my failures and succcesses, my experiments and results, over the following year. As I have been learning French, I have made this github both in French and English, and hopefully in a manner that is clear and comprehensible to anyone who reads either language. Please feel free to correct my French, if I make any mistakes, as I will be studying intensely in Paris this entire summer, and I wish to improve. Finally, the objective of my studies is to create and research new technologies.

Here is a table I generated using GPT that captures the complexity of building each model by hand. When I say the models have been built 'by hand', I mean that the only tools I have used are the numpy library for linear algebra operations and the mathematical equations of these models. It also functions as a checklist, with the date under Completed being the day I finished the implementation of the model, and underlined example models being the ones I concretely implemented. Of course, I do not expect to be anywhere near building all of these by hand by the end of the summer, but I hope to have at least gone through a significant portion of this checklist. Moreover, every built model is accompanied with a corresponding project that demonstrates its capicity and performance against library models. Finally, some projects will have two models if the task for which I am building them is very similar (for example, a clustering unsupervised learning task will have both the clustering and expectation-maximization algorithms implemented). Feel free to copy the table for your own projects.
