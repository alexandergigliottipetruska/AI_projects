# Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Studies
In order to document and track my progression in Deep Learning and AI, I've created this github repository to track and review my experiments and results.

For many models, numpy is used, but it becomes infeasible for larger architectures, so models are implemented via PyTorch. Moreover, every built model is accompanied with a corresponding project that demonstrates its capicity and performance against library models. Finally, some projects will have two models if the task for which I am building them is very similar. Note that very large models like Transformers, GPT/LLMs, Stable Diffusion or Multimodal will have their own repository, simply due to scale.

Models: 
- Linear Models - <ins>Linear Regression, LASSO, Ridge, and Logistic Regression</ins>
- Instance-Based - <ins>KNN</ins>
- Clustering - <ins>K-Means</ins>
- Neural Networks <ins>Shallow NN</ins> 
- Recurrent Neural Network <ins>Vanilla RNN</ins>
- Convolutional Neural Network - ?
- LSTM - ?
- Transformer - ? 
- Bidirectional Transformer (BERT) - ? currently working on
- GPT-2 - ? 
- Stable Diffusion - ? 
- Multimodal - ? 


Thank you for your time and attention.
